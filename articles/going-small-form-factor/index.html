	<p>I have a Linux box running at home for various reasons : performing long-running compilations, toying with new open source projects, self host some services and more broadly just experiment ! </p>
	<br>
	<p>Back in 2013, using my first (intern) paycheck, I decided to build a mid-end gaming PC. It's not a beast, but makes a perfect linux box (check out the specs below).</p>
	<br>
	<p>There's just one problem : it's incredibly BULKY ... </p>
	<br>
	<div class="px-24">
		<img src="images/IMG_1.jpg"></img>
		<p><small><i>The absolute unit of a case. I live in a small Parisian flat, with a small living room, I think it's safe to say that the case STANDS OUT (apple for scale)</i></small></p>
	</div>
	<br>
	<p>This is why I was so excited when I stumbled upon a very interesting sub-reddit called <a href="https://reddit.com/r/sffpc">SFFPC</a>, as in <b>S</b>mall <b>F</b>orm <b>F</b> <b>PC</b>.</p>
	<p>Going against the tide of having the biggest, most obnoxiously RGB-lit, and water-cooled case : Those folks are trying to squeeze in spec'ed out PC in ridiculously small cases.</p>
	<br>
	<p>This felt like a revelation : I need to strip my PC down of all its bulky and irrelevant components, to make it as small as possible, while preserving its performance !</p>
	<br>
	<p>I set out to tackle this project with a few principles in mind : </p>
	<ul class="bg-grey-lighter">
		<li>Re-using most of my current hardware</li><p><small><i>➡️ That meant reusing my CPU, RAM, HDD, as much as possible.</i></small></p>
		<li>Buying second hand as most as possible </li><p><small><i>➡️ We're already producing so much e-waste, I'm trying to minimize my contribution here ... </i></small></p>
		<li>Doing this on a tight budget</li><p><small><i>➡️ The total cost of the operation should not exceed 300 euros.</i></small></p>
	</ul>
	<br>	
	<p>With these constraints in mind, it was time to fire up Leboncoin and eBay and go on a hunt for used pieces !</p>
	<br>
	<p>The first step was to find a motherboard that has a way smaller form factor than my old one, and that allows me to re-use my CPU & RAM. </p>
	<p>I previously heard about small form factors for motherboards like Micro-ATX, Mini-ITX, and even Nano-ITX, but never even considered them ! </p>
	<br>
	<p>I decided to go for a Mini-ITX motherboard and was surprised to see how the offering for such cards is much more developed than a few years ago.</p>
	<p>
	<p>I settled for a used MSI H81I that I found on eBay.</p>
	<div class="px-24">
		<img src="images/IMG_3.jpg"/>
		<p class="text-center"><small><i>A before/after picture : We're going small form factor baby!</i></small></p>
	</div>
	
	<br>
	<p>This motherboard is roughly equivalent to the one I had that I underutilized, compatible with my CPU and my RAM, and is just incredibly smaller !</p>
	<p>The first objective was thus completed ! </p>
	<br>
	<p class="px-12 py-6 my-6 bg-grey-lighter">✅ Re-using my current hardware at maximum </p>
	<p>Then, the hardest part came : Picking a discreet, and compact case ... </p>
	<br>
	<p>My requirements were tough : In addition to being small and discreet, the case should be in the living room, sitting on the lowest shelf of my bookshelf, next to my router ... </p>
	<br>
	<p>I started hunting for cases, and found out that there's many, many manufacturers that offer small form factor cases : ranging from low cost ones, to high-end produced in limited quantity ones ... There's even people that 3D-print their own cases ! </p>
	<br>
	<p>There's <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1AddRvGWJ_f4B6UC7_IftDiVudVc8CJ8sxLUqlxVsCz4/edit">this</a> incredible spreadsheet, painstakingly put together by redditors, that allows you to search for a case using size-related filters : It's useful, but felt a bit overwhelming. </p>
	<br>
	<p>My main problem with all these cases, was their height ... Every case I found was too high for the space between my shelves ...</p>
	<br>
	<p><b>Fortunately,</b> I stumbled HTPC format cases, which are designed to have a similar form factor as your set top box / Blu-Ray player. 
In this category, as soon as I found out about the <b>Silverstone ML09B</b>, it was an instant crush ! </p>
	<br>
	<p>I mean, look !</p>
	<br>
	<img class="p-12" src="images/IMG_5.jpg"/>
	<p>It ticked all the criteria, and I find it stunning ! 
</p>
	<br>
	<p>The only issue is that I couldn't (or maybe was not patient enough) find a used version of the case, and had to buy it brand new. </p>
	<br>
	<p>I then scoured leboncoin and found a used SFX PSU with a low profile CPU cooler on the cheap ! 
Here is a small table that recaps all the parts I bought, whether they are used or not, alongside with their price. </p>

	<br>
	<p>It was then time for the build ! </p>
	<br>
	<img src="images/IMG_2.jpg"/>
	<p>From bulky (what a ridiculously sized cooler) ... </p>
	<img src="images/IMG_4.jpg"/><p>... to very compact!</p>
	<p>I expected to struggle a lot more trying to fit every component in such a tiny box : My concerns were not founded as the build went smooth, and that I don't have to fit a GPU in my case!</p>
	<br>
	<img src="images/IMG_6.jpg"/>
	<p>The completed build ! Isn't it a beauty ?!</p>

	<br>
	<p>The build, in its natural habitat. It's a snug fit! </p>
	<br>
	<img src="images/IMG_7.jpg">
	<img src="images/IMG_8.jpg">
	<p>Overall, I'm pretty proud of this build : It's discreet, the form factor is perfect, and I think it looks very good ! </p>
	<br>
	<p>One great surprise is that it's also super silent ! Thanks to the Zero-RPM of the PSU alongside with the very silent Noctua NH-l9i CPU cooler, the result is a barely audible hum made by the fans when the CPU load is important.</p>
	<br>
	<p>The downside of this build might be that the overall temperature is higher (in the case and for the CPU). But it's a price I'm totally willing to pay for the space it saves me !</p>
	<br>
	<p>Until next time ! </p>
